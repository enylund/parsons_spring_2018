              <li><h2>Assignment</h2></li>
              <li><p>You've all picked a publication that you're interested in. The publication you chose is one that has visual properties, visual games, or visual storytelling elements that appeal to you. For next week the original intention was to translate those elements into a web-based form. I didn't provide enough structure for you to think about what that meant. And after talking to you I got the impression that the assignment is perhaps too linear for everyone to feel engaged by it.</p>
                <br /><p>So a slight revamp of the start of the assignment. You've all chosen interesting and challenging design precedents to inform your work. We've also seen different solutions to similar problems and how an image, or multiple images, on a page can lead to different results, how different versions of hierarchy can impact reading, how white space can impact our perception of the page, etc. All considerations that you will have to think about in the next weeks. The next steps are going to be to propose a redesign of the publications you choose or to propose an application of the design that you've started with. At the same time I want you to think about the content that you want to use for your website. Is that art photography (landscape, portrait, still-life, fashion, etc.?), is it editorial on technology or philosophy, are they color swatches and names, is it poetry or prose, etc. What content do you want to share with the world? </p>
              <br /><p>For next week Tuesday I want you start working on the following things:</p>
              <br /><p>— Analyze what it is that is interesting to you about the publication you chose. Is it typography, white space, color, photography, attitude, personality, expression, etc? At the same time what is it that you're not interested in and would want to change. Try to be as concrete as possible and create a list of characteristics that you think are important to the way you design. Both positive and negative in relation to your own practice as a designer. The reading for next week which I will share tomorrow will provide a way of thinking about this.</p>
              <br /><p>— Start thinking about how you will apply those characteristics/properties/attitudes to the web.  Create 3 different sketches of possible redesigns. Be critical in what you borrow and discard from your references.</p>
              <br /><p>— Pick a piece of content that is close to your heart and think about how you want to display it on the web. Is it spread across different pages, do you scroll down and see it, scroll sideways, click a button to load content, etc.. what is the way that you will share your content with the reader. Think about time, sequence, space, and scale on the web. I am open to thinking about images, colors, shapes, swatches, words, and sounds as content. Don't limit yourself to thinking about copy.</p>
              <br /><p style="text-decoration:underline">To recap:</p>
                <p>Next week, Tuesday, we will look at:</p>
                — A list of things you love and hate about your references
                <br />— 3 sketches showing redesign options based on that list
                <br />— A piece of content that you want to work with</p></li>
